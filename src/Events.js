                            Claromentis is an intranet software provider company. I started working at the Brighton office as a Marketing Designer while I was still attending my final year at the University of Sussex. My primary responsibilities included creating corporate identity
                            for the company; I re-designed their website, and have created marketing materials such as brochures.
                          </p>
                          <p>Since graduating from university, I have also undertaken responsibilities for designing a product for the company. The roles I have been given have provided the perfect opportunity to implement the skills I have gained throughout my higher
                            education, as well as experiencing the running of a successful business.</p>
